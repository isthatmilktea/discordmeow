# discordmeow
getting back into coding so this is my discord bot but rewritten with discord.js v13 (currently updated to v14.7.1) \
this bot isn't really meant to be forked and yk self-hosted or anything, it could be though but you'd have to know how to basically yk do everything. \
this is really just for fun anyways and for me to keep up with this without having the risk of losing all my files. \
have a good day! :)
##### "why is this public then?"
just in case i would need anyone to help me or if anyone has any comments about it or if i wanted to show my friend then i would send them the link to the repo and they would be able to see everything, as i said this repo isn't made with other people using it too in mind, its simply just for me! :p
